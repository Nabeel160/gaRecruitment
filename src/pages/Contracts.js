          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            We understand that staffing services require a foundation of trust and 
            commitment. Our contracts are tailored to meet the specific needs of our 
            clients, providing clarity on responsibilities, timelines, costs, and 
            quality standards. With every contract, you gain peace of mind knowing 
            expectations are documented and legally protected.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Unlike standard templates, our agreements are flexible, scalable, and 
            designed to evolve as your requirements grow. Whether you need short-term 
            event staff or long-term workforce support, we create a partnership 
            grounded in professionalism and fairness.
